China has already demonstrated to the entire world that the strategy for resolving the question of poverty in society lies in carrying out a plan that has been reasoned out and in concentrating strength towards a task that has a reasonable hope of success.......
Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, said that China, by persevering in going its own way, and concentrating its efforts on conquering poverty set an example for the people of every country of the Middle East.
The author starts the discussion from September of that year with Israel's signing the Declaration of Principles of Palestinian Autonomy with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and looks back at the complex struggles of the Middle East over the past several hundred years, especially the most recent half century.
This is what Peres said in the preface he composed especially for the Chinese edition of his just published new work'' The New Middle East.''
Yet the people of our two countries nevertheless are similar to one another.
The great Chinese people offered up to the world cultural riches on the spiritual plane and material plane.
China has already demonstrated to the entire world that the strategy for resolving the question of poverty in society lies in carrying out a plan that has been reasoned out and in concentrating strength towards a task that has a reasonable hope of success.......
Peres said:'' China and Israel are at the two ends of Asia, separated by' ten thousand crags and torrents.'
The book'' The New Middle East'' originally was published as an English edition around the end of autumn last year.
He points out,'' At a time when we are on the threshold of the 21st century, warfare no longer has any use.
This is what Peres said in the preface he composed especially for the Chinese edition of his just published new work'' The New Middle East.''
He said in addition:'' We who live in western Asia are gazing at the east with a look of hope and reverence.

He observed,'' China has already demonstrated that it could conquer poverty and the misery that generations of people have suffered.

To do this, he emphasized,'' We must control the desert that is day - by - day eroding arable land, develop new sources of water, and carry out new engineering projects.''
We hope that China becomes a model that the people of all Middle Eastern countries, including both Israelis and Arabs, can imitate on the road that we walk together heading towards the future.

Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF.
Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.
British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of Rapier surface - to - air missiles.
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.
For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.
British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of Rapier surface - to - air missiles.

September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
`` I think the Friday report, combined with the actions of the Fed, weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
He predicted that inflation will moderate next year, saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide.
`` The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%,'' said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.

Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true.
Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging:
1. That your Sept. 28 editorial `` Kangaroo Committees'' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading.
Unfortunately, by my rough guess, he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth.
As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment.
4. That the Journal defends `` the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD,'' etc. and so forth.
No, to my mind, the Journal did not `` defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust...''
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.''
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.''
4. That the Journal defends `` the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD,'' etc. and so forth.
I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings.
Ah, yes, something called a Star Chamber.
Ah, yes, something called a Star Chamber.
-LRB- Of course, we've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective. -RRB-
Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB-.
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.
4. That the Journal defends `` the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD,'' etc. and so forth.
How was that practice referred to when I was in school?
Individuals can always have their hands slapped.

The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines, but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency.
For example, the delay in selling People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with $1.7 billion in assets, has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch - by - branch, instead of as a whole institution.
After that, the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts.
NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets.
`` These thrifts are beached whales,'' said Bert Ely, an industry consultant based in Alexandria, Va.

Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,'' said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.

`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,'' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.

Today, Peilice Dekuliar, the UN Secretary - General, expressed grief at the multi-national forces air striking Baghdad resulting in civilians deaths.
According to a news report on February 14th by Xinhua News Agency from Beijing, when the multi-national forces carried out an air attack on Baghdad on the 13th, hundreds of civilians were killed in the bombing.
Officials in the Iraqi Department of Defense said that the two missiles or bomb shells dropped by planes of the multi-national forces on the 13th at 4 O'clock in the morning local time hit a large sized underground bomb shelter and, at least 500 civilians hiding inside were killed, more than half of whom were women and children.
The Tunisian government thinks that this bombing again shows that the activity of the multi-national forces has exceeded authorized limits set by the United Nations Security Council decision.
In Amman, capital of Jordan, thousands of angry people paraded and demonstrated in front of the US embassy, objecting to the multi-national forces bombing and killing innocent civilians in Baghdad.

He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt, a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court's opinions.
`` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited,'' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created.

But are these four players, three of them in their 80s, ready to assume a different role after 88 years, collectively, of service on the high court?
Justice Stevens, 69, is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role, in part because he may be the least liberal of the four, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others.

Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is, `` on margin'' -- may be more worried than most following Friday's market drop.
`` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it,'' he said, `` so I doubt you'll see any significant changes'' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline.
Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.
Especially gleeful were the short sellers, who have been pounded by this year's market climb.
`` If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom,'' said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago - based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
The $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, for one, added $1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago.
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart.''
Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again, trapping more investors.
Unlike mutual funds, which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money, big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock.

`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long - term holders, and that they ca n't react to short - term events, good or bad,'' said Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
`` Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst,'' said John W. Rogers, president of Chicago - based Ariel Capital Management Inc., which manages $1.1 billion of stocks.

Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.
The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments.
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled it's willing to entertain the notion, and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law.
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party, including FSLIC.''
`` If true,'' the court wrote, `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds.''
But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate - court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.
But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour.''

For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, `` About Harry Towns.''
Harry is now a 57 - year - old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out - of - synch.
Harry fondly remembers the `` old'' days of the early'70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong.
Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife, who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into Manhattan.
But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out.
