FEDERAL FUNDS:
Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney's office in Baltimore.
Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens, N.Y., company's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes.
Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic.
Bolar, the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General's office of the Health and Human Services Department, only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers, mostly wholesalers,'' Mr. Nesbit said.
The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand - name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin.

The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands.
The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management - controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders.
Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote - diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV.
ASKO says the Dutch - based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders.

In the preface to the Chinese edition, Peres says that the leaders of every country must have vision, relinquish old grudges, and create peace in order to deal with'' challenges of tomorrow.''

This is what Peres said in the preface he composed especially for the Chinese edition of his just published new work'' The New Middle East.''
The author starts the discussion from September of that year with Israel's signing the Declaration of Principles of Palestinian Autonomy with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and looks back at the complex struggles of the Middle East over the past several hundred years, especially the most recent half century.

British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson - CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided - missile divisions, greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.
Already, British Aerospace and French government - controlled Thomson - CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air - traffic control radar system.
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.
Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF.
For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.
In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.; to better compete, Thomson officials say, they need a partnership.
To justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.
Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about # 950 million, a Thomson spokesman said.
British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of Rapier surface - to - air missiles.
Thomson missile products, with about half British Aerospace's annual revenue, include the Crotale surface - to - air missile family.

British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson - CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided - missile divisions, greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.
After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.
The companies hope for a final agreement by year - end.
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.

For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.
The venture's importance for Thomson is great.
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans.
In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.; to better compete, Thomson officials say, they need a partnership.
To justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace - Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.
The 50 - 50 joint venture, which may be dubbed Eurodynamics, would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion -LRB- $2.17 billion -RRB- and would be among the world's largest missile makers.
After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.
The missile venture, the British Aerospace spokeswoman said, is a needed response to the `` new environment'' in defense contracting.
To justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.
Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.
GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged last year.
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.
A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials.
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti: `` Competition is the name of the game,'' she said.
At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists it is n't interested in Ferranti.

GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged last year.
The venture's importance for Thomson is great.
For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.
But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford, Conn. - based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces.
Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about # 950 million, a Thomson spokesman said.

Most threatened by closer British Aerospace - Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.
Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF.
`` We have nothing to say about this affair, which does n't concern us,'' a Matra official said Sunday.

But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid, the source indicated.

September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
`` The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%,'' said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump.
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index, but the 0.9% climb was higher than most anticipated.
But Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler - Distributors, said that last month's rise `` is n't as bad an omen'' as the 0.9% figure suggests.
`` If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than being a broad - based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods,'' he explained.
Many analysts said the September increase was a one - time event, coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models.
But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices, analysts said.
After falling for three consecutive months, the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9% last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer.
Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit, the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5% in September, to $145.21 billion.

Passenger car prices jumped 3.8% in September, after climbing 0.5% in August and declining in the late spring and summer.
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1% in September, while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1%.
Meanwhile, the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8% in September to $32.82 billion.
Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4% in September, after dropping for three consecutive months.
Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes -LRB- 1982 = 100 -RRB- for September, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from September, 1988.
September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
Although the report, which was released before the stock market opened, did n't trigger the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, analysts said it did play a role in the market's decline.
Analysts immediately viewed the price data, the grimmest inflation news in months, as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped.
But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers.

All year, energy prices have skewed the producer price index, which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods.
Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter, when a steep run - up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double - digit annual rates.
Energy prices then plummeted through the summer, causing the index to decline for three consecutive months.
Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year, the Labor Department said.

Moreover, this year's good inflation news may have ended last month, when energy prices zoomed up 6.5% after plunging 7.3% in August.
Passenger car prices jumped 3.8% in September, after climbing 0.5% in August and declining in the late spring and summer.
Food prices declined 0.6%, after climbing 0.3% in August.
Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7% after declining 0.6% in August, while sales of building materials fell 1.8% after rising 1.7%.

Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging:
2. That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment.
'' That certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading'' indicated by Mr. Lantos.
By any `` reasonable man'' criterion, Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted.
Of course, Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change.
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true.
No, Mr. Lantos's complaints simply wo n't wash.
The problem, which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles, is not the likes of Mr. Lantos, who after all is really a bit player on the stage, but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary / judicial body.
I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings.
Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging:

The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.''
Thus, in a criminal case, a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness, thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth.''
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.''
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good - faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
As I watched him on C - Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings.
He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution.

No, to my mind, the Journal did not `` defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust...''
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and, yes, maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate.
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true.
Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging:
Thus, in a criminal case, a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness, thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth.''
No, Mr. Lantos's complaints simply wo n't wash.
'' That certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading'' indicated by Mr. Lantos.
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.''
I do not by any means defend HUD management.
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
No doubt that's partially true.
As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment.
By any `` reasonable man'' criterion, Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted.
Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB-.
As I watched him on C - Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings.
1. That your Sept. 28 editorial `` Kangaroo Committees'' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading.
Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good - faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
Parsippany, N.J.
As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment.
My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court... etc.''
By any `` reasonable man'' criterion, Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted.
3. That his `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD.
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense.
Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB-.
The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` Tail Gunner Joe'' McCarthy did his work.
As I watched him on C - Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings.
Ah, yes, something called a Star Chamber.

Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB-.
I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings.
Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify.
Individuals can always have their hands slapped.
But if his explanation of motivation is true, why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity?
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
The system is the problem, not an individual member.
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and, yes, maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate.
But if his explanation of motivation is true, why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity?
The privilege, however, has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only.
It's when such slapping does n't occur that we've got trouble.
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.''
The privilege, however, has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only.
The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.
Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self - incrimination.
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and, yes, maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate.
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and, yes, maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate.
The problem, which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles, is not the likes of Mr. Lantos, who after all is really a bit player on the stage, but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary / judicial body.
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and, yes, maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate.
No, to my mind, the Journal did not `` defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust...''

Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two - step, 830 million Canadian - dollar -LRB- US$705.6 million -RRB- expansion of its system because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking.
Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,'' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.
Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.
Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.

Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.
Under terms of its proposed two - step expansion, which would have required regulatory approval, Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system, beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.

Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,'' said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.
Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.
Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York - based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
That ranks Canada as the fourth - largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast - shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East.

`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,'' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.
`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,'' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.
Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.
Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,'' said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.
Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.
Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York - based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.

Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast - shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East.
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.

Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.

Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.

When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure.
For the first time, the 83 - year - old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech.
He, like Justice Brennan, considers dissents highly important for the future, a point that has n't escaped legal scholars.

`` Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result,'' he said.
Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years.

`` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited,'' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created.
Associates of 81 - year - old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed'' about the court's direction last spring, but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights.
Justice Blackmun, who will turn 81 next month, also seems feisty about his new role.
Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years.
Justice Stevens, 69, is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role, in part because he may be the least liberal of the four, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others.

He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous `` I Have a Dream'' speech from the 1963 March on Washington.

He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous `` I Have a Dream'' speech from the 1963 March on Washington.
For the first time, the 83 - year - old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
`` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited,'' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created.
`` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future,'' he says.
Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues, especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion, Roe vs. Wade.
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role, and the frustrations that go with it, but in different ways.
Justice Blackmun, who will turn 81 next month, also seems feisty about his new role.
Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years.
Now, however, as the court's new five - member conservative majority continues to solidify, victories for the liberals are rare.
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.

He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt, a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court's opinions.
Justice Blackmun, who will turn 81 next month, also seems feisty about his new role.

Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues, especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion, Roe vs. Wade.
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.
This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.

Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual, but reasonable,'' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said.
Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect -LCB- margin calls -RCB- to be as big a factor as in 1987'' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin, a spokesman said.

Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
Denver - based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund he oversees.
`` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash.''
`` If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom,'' said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago - based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
`` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it,'' he said, `` so I doubt you'll see any significant changes'' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline.
Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index, have been stellar performers this year, rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends.
Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades.
Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart.''
`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value,'' said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn.
Even without portfolio insurance, market conditions were grim Friday, money managers said.
Neil Weisman, whose New York - based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months, said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands.
Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.
`` We're ahead for the year because of Friday,'' said the firm's Kurt Feshbach.
And they plan to buy more today.
To be sure, big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today.
Rightly or wrongly, many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash: Buying at the bottom pays off.

He said he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading.
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash.
In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected.

He said he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading.
`` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market,'' said James D. Awad, president of New York - based BMI Capital Corp.
But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse.
`` If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom,'' said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago - based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long - term holders, and that they ca n't react to short - term events, good or bad,'' said Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart.''
Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
The shorts sell borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price.
Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again, trapping more investors.
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash.
`` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it,'' he said, `` so I doubt you'll see any significant changes'' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline.
`` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market,'' said James D. Awad, president of New York - based BMI Capital Corp.
`` If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom,'' said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago - based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades.
And they plan to buy more today.
Denver - based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund he oversees.
Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index, have been stellar performers this year, rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends.
`` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything,'' said Mr. Weisman, who, happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier, declined the offers.

Neil Weisman, whose New York - based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months, said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands.

Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.
The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments.
Though the argument may have a common - sense ring to it, even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position.

The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate - court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate - court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments.
But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.
Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits, because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988.
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills, which topped $73 million last year.
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled it's willing to entertain the notion, and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law.
`` We're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory,'' he says.

The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and, of course, the Yankees.
However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in `` Bonfire of the Vanities'' -- as a wrong turn into hell.
The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel, which flashes back to the New York of the'50s.
But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the'50s, is something else altogether.
Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: ``... outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures.''
Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really was n't ordinary.
The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them, for example -RRB- seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure.

In a lovely, novelistic memoir, `` Sleeping Arrangements'' -LRB- Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95 -RRB-, she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell - kitten Diana, age five -RRB-.

Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all.
She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria'' into the `` Babylonian Bronx,'' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working - class people lived in drab, Soviet - style buildings `` glamorized'' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB-, whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.
For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.

Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really was n't ordinary.
She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie, whom she remembers as a loving liar, who realigned history to explain why Lily's father did n't live with them.
Rosie reinvented this man, who may or may not have known about his child, as a war hero for Lily's benefit.

Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who did n't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting.
Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work - in - progress, `` Philosophy for Women.''

Her friend Susan, whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor.

With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB-; and Uncle Len, a mysterious part - time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an `` undercover President on a good - will mission.''

Harry is now a 57 - year - old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out - of - synch.
Harry fondly remembers the `` old'' days of the early'70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong.
Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife, who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into Manhattan.

The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and, of course, the Yankees.
But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the'50s, is something else altogether.
But both the past and present worlds of `` The Current Climate'' -LRB- Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95 -RRB- feel cramped and static.

Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho.
Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho.
In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources, which was a part - owner of the smelter, that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program.
Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern, potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter's cleanup costs.
The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA, it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization.''
The company, which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday, said that $1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third - quarter statement.
The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval, the company said.
Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law.''
Under the agreement, Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock.
In addition, Gulf must give the government 20 days' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $50 million that are made to the Bermuda - based holding company.
Separately, the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization.

In the past two years, Guangdong Province has exerted itself to explore new ways of attracting talent under market economy conditions, and has been active in using market mechanisms to allocate resources of talent, and has achieved preliminary results.
'' Taking the first step'' in Guangdong's reform and opening up in the 1980's was closely related to the situation at that time of the'' Peafowl Flying Towards the Southeast'' -LRB- human talents from all over, one after another, going to Guangdong -RRB-.

Further enhancing the attraction to talented persons has become the key point of Guangdong's further development.
Limo Qin, director of the Talent Exchange and Service Center of Guangdong Province has done analysis and said:'' the economic development rate of Guangdong in 1993 was at an intermediate level of that in the recent years.

Developing at this rate, in the next ten years, not including graduates from higher education institutes, Guangdong's talent gap is conservatively estimated to surpass 1 million.
Therefore, further opening minds and introducing talent are guidelines of Guangdong's policy regarding talented people.''
In recent years, there have been more and more climaxes in Guangdong's talent market.
In the whole year of 1993, talent exchange centers of personnel departments across the province registered more than 463,000 people applying for jobs.
Since 1991 when Shenzhen established the first standing talent market, such'' all - weather'' talent exchange organizations have rapidly spread in the Zhujiang Delta and all cities within the province.
Now, there are fifteen cities with relatively more advanced economies in the province having built up regular markets.
In order to further enhance the attraction of talent, to break through the barrier of'' departmental ownership'' of talent, and to promote the flow of talent by forming mechanisms of independent employment and job choice, Guangdong Province has also paid greater attention to the formulation of relevant policies and regulations.
Limo Qin said in his introduction that in recent years the provincial government has successively issued documents such as'' Temporary regulations on encouraging persons studying abroad to work in Guangdong'','' Notices on better advertising for talent'', etc.
It will soon promulgate documents such as'' Detailed rules for implementing temporary regulations on resignations of specialists, technicians and managers in state - owned units'' and'' Supplementary regulations of Guangdong Province on the management of Chinese side cadres in foreign investment enterprises'', etc.
With the overall opening up of China's coastal areas, frontier areas, riverside areas and capital cities of every province since the 1990's, the flow of talent tends to be multi-directional and the competition has become increasingly fierce.
1006 students abroad filled out application forms, and quite a number of people have successively returned to China to take jobs.

Now kindred spirits on Addison's town council have barred the town's fanciest hotel, the Grand Kempinski, from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge.
Addison is no stranger to cans of worms, either.
And the mayor, in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill's, warned that `` alcohol leads to betting, which leads to fights.''
`` Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on,'' says Tom Manske, vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association.
Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison's main street.
Now kindred spirits on Addison's town council have barred the town's fanciest hotel, the Grand Kempinski, from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge.

Mao - tai, which is made in the Chishui river valley area in the northern part of Guizhou Province in southwest China, is known for its extremely special fermentation technique.
After a total of 10 months fermentation, which requires adding material twice, distilling 7 times, fermenting 8 times, and braising and boiling 9 times, the spirit is then put into specially made earthen jars, sealed and stored for over three years.
The water used comes from the Chishui river that flows over cinnabar quality soil and selectively uses such locally produced raw materials as sorghum, high quality wheat, etc. and is fermented during the period from the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival to the Double Ninth Festival.
What makes Mao - tai even more famous is that first generation leaders of new China had used it to entertain distinguished guests such as former president Nixon of the US, Tanaka Kakuei, former prime minister of Japan, etc.

In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.
GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.
GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.
The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.
Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987.
Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s.
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match.
The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray'' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information,'' Mr. Yokich said.
GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro - Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec, company and union officials said.
He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A - body cars into the mid-1990s.
At Pontiac, however, the Camaro - Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic - bodied, two - seater Pontiac Fiero model.
The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union - management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.

Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year.
The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.
GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin.

The Van Nuys plant, which employs about 3,000 workers, does n't have a product to build after 1993.
Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant,'' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand.
At the Oklahoma City plant, which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight - year - old A - body mid-sized cars, Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said the plant has no new product lined up, and `` none of us knows'' when the A - body cars will die.

Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's `` flagrant insensitivity'' toward union members.
