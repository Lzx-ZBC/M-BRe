Makoto Utsumi, vice minister for international affairs, said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy-out.
The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general, Mr. Utsumi said.
The comments were the ministry's first detailed public statement on the subject, and reflect the ministry's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets.
A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another.

Sanwa Bank Ltd. is one Japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first UAL proposal.
A Sanwa Bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank's decision.
Still, Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks.
All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry's real position.
Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive, observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason.
At a news conference this week, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent'' stance regarding highly leveraged deals.

The explosion sent shards of metal flying, severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems, and led to the crash that killed 112 people.
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.

The New York Times Co. said it reached a settlement with independent home delivery dealers in the metropolitan New York area that will free the newspaper to expand home delivery circulation.
The settlement stemmed from a lawsuit the dealers filed in 1982 when the Times began its own competing direct delivery service.
The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $3.6 million over six years, as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years, based on the number of `` new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures,'' the Times said.

Indeed, Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs'' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter.
But the rate of the decline snowballed in August, with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5% from a year earlier, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.

We're happy, we guess, to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.
Without question, something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo.
Our own test of `` glasnost's'' authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk.

Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself.

Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government.
But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling.
The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or, alternatively, that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident.

The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.
The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.
As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities.
At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings.
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils.
`` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature,'' a solicitor representing one of the banks said.

Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule'' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers.
The Big Board's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price.

As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
To offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions.
Some Democrats, led by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts.

Moreover, junk professionals think Columbia's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $4.4 billion was n't enough, meaning another markdown could be coming.
But in recent days, Columbia has edged up, closing at 5, up 3\/8, yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure.
Mr. Spiegel's fans say Columbia's Southern California branches are highly salable, and the thrift has $458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.

That's why Columbia just wrote off $130 million of its junk and reserved $227 million for future junk losses.
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value, unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right.

USX Corp. posted a 23% drop in third-quarter profit, as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations.
In the 1988 period, USX also had a $71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement.
However, third-quarter operating profit fell 14%, as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments, eliminating income from those operations.
Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that a downturn in the appliance industry, coupled with sluggish automotive sales, hurt USX results.

Moreover, USX exports more than other steelmakers, and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure.
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain, Ohio, plant, which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan's Kobe Steel Ltd.

Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $33 a ton from $42 a ton last year and $53 a ton in the second quarter, analysts said.
Still, USX fared better than other major steelmakers, earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp., which posted a 54% drop in net income, or Inland Steel Industries Inc., whose profit plummeted 70%.

McCaw is seeking 50.3% of the cellular and broadcasting concern; the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN.

BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34% jump in third-quarter earnings, as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans, higher interest margins and negligible loan losses.
For the quarter, BankAmerica said it earned $254 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $190 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.
BankAmerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake.
For the first time in nearly two years, BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters, but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors.
Moreover, BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $170 million, about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $100 million in the year-earlier quarter.
The provision rate was far above BankAmerica's actual net credit losses of $24 million in the third quarter, compared with $18 million in the second period and $38 million a year earlier.
As a result, BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans, once below 25%, now amounts to 45% of the $6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations.
That level is about the same as some other big banks, but far below the 85% and 100% reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & amp; Co., respectively.

Profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end.

Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate, currently about 4%, `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession, but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output.''

For one thing, even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last, tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990, the analysts say.

His giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets'' by punishing the `` real robbers'' -- the rich `` dogs'' who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents, and eventually to his own.
Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray.

I was struck a couple of years ago by the drug-interdiction effort in the Bahamas.

The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars.
So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about.
The efforts to get to the people who are addicted, try to rehabilitate them; if they can not be rehabilitated, at least to contain them; to educate people, to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users, to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important.
The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before, in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs.

You're looking at a guy whose motorcade was attacked in Bolivia by the drug terrorists, so I'm personally a veteran of this war.
Frankly, the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost.
When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives, including, I might say, the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted, so that they create a market for themselves.

Sam Ramirez and his men are late.
They pile out of their truck and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the Sharpshooter, a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep.
If they finish today, the Sharpshooter can pump tomorrow.
`` We've been putting in long hours,'' Mr. Ramirez says -- six-day weeks and 13-hour days for the last two months.
Independent drillers are gingerly sinking bits into the Earth's crust again.

`` It would be surprising if they did n't come to Frankfurt in time for 1992, and they bring an interesting tradition.
But the market really is n't going to be stood on its head,'' said a banker at one of Frankfurt's Big Three banks.
The return of the Rothschilds is modest.
The new representative office, with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the Rothschild family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own.
Instead, it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family's mainstay banking units: N M Rothschild & amp; Sons Ltd. in London, Rothschild & amp; Cie. in Paris and Rothschild Bank AG in Zurich.

`` Obviously, there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide,'' concedes Baron David de Rothschild, `` but we feel we have some cards to play.''
Among them, he says, is the family's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout Europe and beyond.
The Rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors.
As at the Zurich bank, the minimum investment for individuals will be high: about a million German marks ($538,000), three times what many other West German investment banks require.
`` But we do make exceptions,'' says a smiling Baron Elie de Rothschild, `` especially if they are very young and have very rich parents.
Swedish rolling-steel and ball-bearing group AB SKF said its pretax profit rose 78% to 1.78 billion kronor ($278 million) in the first nine months from one billion kronor ($156 million) in the corresponding period a year earlier.
SKF said sales increased 17% to 18.46 billion kronor from 15.72 billion.

The company said the situation in the U.S. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings.
Analysts said SKF's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor.

Some analysts are concerned, however, that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities.
If that proves true, analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992, when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers.

Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports.
At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth.

As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ($7.04 billion) as of Dec. 31, 1986, to its current 522 billion pesetas.
The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs.
Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November, Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes.
Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November, Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes.
But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy, cut costs, increase capital and build up new areas of business.
In Mr. Luzon's first year, the bank eliminated 800 jobs.
The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad.
To strengthen its capital base, Banco Exterior this year issued $105 million in subordinated debt, launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors.
Though Spain has an excess of banks, analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe, which will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead.

The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition.

In addition, the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization.''
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference, bureaucratic resistance, a legal system that operates at a snail's pace, political opposition and government misjudgments.
The Asset Privatization Trust, the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties, has recorded sales of more than $500 million since it began functioning in December 1986.
Ramon Garcia, the Asset Trust's executive trustee, admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks.''

October's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank, Associated Bank, for the minimum price of 671 million pesos ($31 million).
In addition, special bidding rules give the bank's former owner, Leonardo Ty, the right to match the highest bid.
Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution.
In 1983, the loans were converted into equity, giving Manila 98% of the bank, but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights.

Separately, the government will try again within a month to sell the 36% stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines, or Picop, as the paper mill is known.
Separately, the government will try again within a month to sell the 36% stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines, or Picop, as the paper mill is known.
The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market.
As it stands now, the government would continue to hold 45% of Picop after the 36% stake is sold.
(About 7.5% of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity.)
The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers, including a member of the Elders group of Australia, to pull out of the bidding, the bankers and analysts say.

Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer.
Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer.
Under government regulations, however, foreign ownership of Picop's equity is limited to 40%.
Even though the government would retain the 45% stake in Picop, critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners.
A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale.
Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill's sale, both prompted by the criticism of the agency.

The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines, in which it has a 99% stake.
The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed.
Guillermo Ortiz's Sept. 15 Americas column, `` Mexico's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug,'' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government's commitment to privatization, and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well.

The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico's undersecretary of finance view his country's reforms `` in the context of a larger, world-wide process'' of profound change toward free-market economics, especially in the statist countries.
It is not quite true, for example, that the Mexican government has `` privatized'' Mexicana de Aviacion, as Mr. Ortiz claims.
It is not quite true, for example, that the Mexican government has `` privatized'' Mexicana de Aviacion, as Mr. Ortiz claims.
Regrettably, too, Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game'' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 { state enterprises } currently remain in the public sector,'' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982.
'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico; indeed, they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure.
They are officially considered `` strategic,'' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution.
In language that sidesteps the issue, Mr. Ortiz writes, `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas's plan to modernize Mexico's economy....''

To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized, Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability.

At a private dinner Thursday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
Mr. Joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray, according to people familiar with the discussion.
He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise.
He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise.
Amid the market disorder, even Drexel, which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors, is pulling in its horns.
Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market, Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors.
`` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market, and it could take years before it's over,'' says Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & amp; Poor's Corp., a credit rating company.

Wall Street securities firms, `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market,'' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses, Deltec said in a recent, grim report to customers.
Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal'' redemptions by shareholders, Deltec said.
Investors, trying to raise cash, have sold `` large liquid issues'' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co.; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress.

And, Deltec said, buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation.
`` In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter,'' Deltec said.
Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively, building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality.

Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August because of falling junk prices.
`` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something to be concerned about,'' says James A. Gregoire, a managing director.
The junk market's `` yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson,'' he says.
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default, the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble, says Stuart Reese, manager of Aetna Life & amp; Casualty Insurance Co.'s $17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio.

Mr. Asquith, whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April, says this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings.
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults, Mr. Asquith says, is that about half of the $3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S & amp; P this year are junk bonds sold during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986.

Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume.
September program trading amounted to 13.8% of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares, the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures public in July 1988.
The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks.
Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September, but most of the firm's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage.
Overall, Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares.
The top stock-index arbitrage firm last month was Morgan Stanley & amp; Co.
Of Morgan Stanley's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month, 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades.

In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco, Mr. Durkin comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences.''
Mr. Durkin doubts that `` there is some magic level'' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems.''
The chart below shows why (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).
Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier,'' Mr. Durkin says.
And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit,'' Mr. Durkin says, `` much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families,'' that is, `` those probably best able to handle it.''
`` The most frequent use is home improvement, which presumably improves the value of the property,'' Mr. Durkin says.
So, it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain, as the chart shows, reassuringly below some earlier highs (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).

The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with American Telephone & amp; Telegraph's Reach Out America plan.
MCI claims about 12% of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10% of the $23 billion residential market.
The company wants its business mix to more closely match that of AT & amp; T -- a step it says will help prevent cross subsidization.

For an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore.

In sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers' lives -- at the regimented office, where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home'' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker.

It's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of letting a young, short-term American employee take on any responsibility.
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman.

Mr. Dinkins, the ad charges, also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately, hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members, no receipts and no office.''
`` David Dinkins,'' says the kicker, `` Why does he always wait until he's caught?''
`` Nasty innuendoes,'' says John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins's issues director, `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist.''

Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight'' when he was being considered for a city job.

Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag, an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty'' that Virginians have nurtured for generations.
Then, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: `` On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians.''

That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest,'' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.

The ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad.
The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.
Then an announcer interjects: `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women, ask him about this law he tried to pass.''
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.
The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request,'' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation.

By Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder's sensitivity to rape victims.

And the nose on Mr. Courter's face grows.

Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration.
Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades.
But Japan's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions.
The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine,'' says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp.

The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $10,000 in cash.
The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business'' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300.
The form asks for such details as the client's name, Social Security number, passport number and details about the services provided for the payment.
Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November, when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years, citing attorney-client privilege.
Until last week, the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms.
`` This form forces a lawyer to become, in effect, a witness against his client,'' said Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts.
Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers.
Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients, he said.
The defense lawyers' group formed a task force this week, chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt, to deal with the matter.

On Tuesday, the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm.
The reason: the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise.
Federal judges make $89,500 annually; in February, Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50%.
Judge Ramirez, 44, said it is unjust for judges to make what they do.

For all of this year's explosive run-up in stock prices, Renaissance Investment Management Inc.'s computer sat on the sidelines.
Renaissance, a Cincinnati-based money manager, began buying stocks again this week with half of the $1.8 billion that it oversees for clients, according to people familiar with the firm's revised strategy.
Renaissance, a Cincinnati-based money manager, began buying stocks again this week with half of the $1.8 billion that it oversees for clients, according to people familiar with the firm's revised strategy.
It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning.
Renaissance declined to confirm the move, but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday, timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm.
Renaissance declined to confirm the move, but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday, timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm.
The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being.
Wall Street executives said they believed that Renaissance's $900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc.
Wall Street executives said they believed that Renaissance's $900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc.
As reported, PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift, although the broker's client was said then to have been Japanese.
Yesterday, PaineWebber declined comment.
When it owns stocks, Renaissance's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues; to make buy or sell moves, the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance, looking for the best package price to carry out the trades.
Renaissance's last portfolio shift, carried out by Goldman, Sachs & amp; Co., was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills.

The Dow average now stands more than 20% higher, while Renaissance's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year.
The computer's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance.
Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results, while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills.
Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results, while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills.
So why does Renaissance's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28, where it closed yesterday, when it did n't with the Dow at 2200?
`` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates, stocks are representing a better value all the time,'' Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday.
`` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates, stocks are representing a better value all the time,'' Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday.
Mr. Terrizzi wo n't say specifically, explaining that if there was such a move, it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction.
During that time, a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand.
But everything is relative to Mr. Terrizzi, so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills, even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in January.
When the computer says switch, Renaissance switches.
Competing asset-allocation firms march to their own computer models, so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while Renaissance has sat on the sidelines.
As a result, competitors say Renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market, rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in Treasury bills.

Mr. Terrizzi confirms some clients have left Renaissance, but no major ones, and the firm has added new accounts.

Conner Peripherals Inc., which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers, is on target to surpass Compaq Computer Corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in U.S. business history.
Conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers.
For the nine months, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84% to $26.9 million, or 69 cents a share, from $14.6 million, or 43 cents a share.
For the nine months, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84% to $26.9 million, or 69 cents a share, from $14.6 million, or 43 cents a share.
Analysts expect Conner's earnings to reach roughly $40 million, or $1 to $1.05 a share, on sales of $650 million, for 1989, the company's third full year in business.
That's a faster growth rate than reported by Compaq, which did n't post similar results until its fourth year, in 1986.
But Compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up.
Conner's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers, the computer industry's fastest-growing segment.
Since its inception, Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines.
Today, Conner controls an estimated 90% of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers.
The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems, the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops, and to Toshiba Corp., NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp., the leading Japanese laptop makers.

Next month, Seagate Technology, which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers, plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers.
And the Japanese are likely to keep close on Conner's heels.

But Conner is n't standing still.
`` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our (older) products,'' said Finis Conner, chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name.
These new products could account for as much as 35% of the company's business in 1990, Mr. Conner estimated.
Conner already is shipping its new drives.
Last week, for instance, Compaq introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews.
Conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine, which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase.
From its inception, Conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines, building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as Seagate.

Though the service is available only in California, Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states.
Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep.
There also are `` 800'' hotlines which refer people to lawyers, usually personal-injury specialists, for in-office consultation.
When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW, a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys.
In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue, Cane lawyers review documents and perform research, if necessary, with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers.
If the matter requires further legal work or litigation, Mr. Cane says, his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm.
But he says Cane & amp; Associates does n't receive referral fees.
So far, says Mr. Cane, most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems, tax problems, divorce, and probate questions.

Westmoreland Coal Co., realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity, reported sharply improved third-quarter results.
The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $5.9 million, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of $145.4 million.
In an interview, Pemberton Hutchinson, president and chief executive, cited several reasons for the improvement: higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions'' in the mines, as well as lower costs for materials, administrative overhead and debt interest.
In the latest nine months, Mr. Hutchinson said, total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier.
Westmoreland's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region.

For the past couple of years, Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business.
`` I think the ship is now righted, the bilges are pumped and we are on course,'' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program.
But he cautioned that Westmoreland's third quarter is typically better than the fourth, so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four'' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained.
Nevertheless, Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable'' for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same.''

Separately, Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2% to $65.2 million, or 57 cents a share, from $63.9 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period.
For the nine months, Gillette's net income declined 1% to $205.3 million, or $2.02 a share, from $207 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1988 period.

China's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall.
In a report on China's foundering economy, the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9% from a year earlier - the lowest growth rate in a decade for September.

`` The economy is crashing hard,'' says an Asian economist in Beijing.
In China, however, there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state.
In China, however, there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state.
Instead, China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises, which ate up $18 billion in bailouts last year. Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt.
Rather, the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township'' enterprises, which have fallen into disfavor as China's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership.
`` When the going gets rough, China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent,'' says a Western economist.
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks.
Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls, particularly by loosening credit.
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People's Bank of China, the central bank, to allocate $5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest, the official China Daily reported.

The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979.
And, because China's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy, it is likely to continue, analysts say.
The statistical bureau's report, cited in China Daily, notes that industrial output in September totaled $29.4 billion, a rise of just 0.9% from a year earlier.
Output declined in several provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, two key coastal areas, and Sichuan, the nation's agricultural breadbasket.

Black & amp; Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $2.8 billion.

The move significantly expanded Black & amp; Decker's product line, but also significantly increased its debt load.
The acquisition boosted Black & amp; Decker's ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80%.
Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50% over the next 2 years. Earlier this year, Black & amp; Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block: the information and electronics segment, the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors.

Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value.
The British chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million ($473 million) and # 400 million, analysts said.
The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter.
Courtaulds' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion.
Courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders.
Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.

The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31.
Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined.
In addition, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities.
Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year.

Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35% from a year earlier on weakness in the company's mainstay chemicals and plastics business.

Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert.
Whoever constitute the local Left Bank come out in force, dressed in black, along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge.
People in Glass houses tend to look stoned.
Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone.
The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does.
Philip Glass is the emperor, and his music the new clothes, of the avant-garde.
Softly introducing and explaining his pieces, Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital.
Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum `` less is more.''
But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex.
`` Opening'' (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: Never straying too far from the piano's center, Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys.

When used as background in this way, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two-note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film.
Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz's sense that the 1974 `` Music in Twelve Parts'' is as encyclopedic and weighty as `` The Well-Tempered Clavier.''

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges, a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders.
The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites `` problems'' associated with the practice.
The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations.
The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions.

The study, by the CFTC's division of economic analysis, shows that `` a trade is a trade,'' a member of the study team said.
`` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market,'' Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel.

Yesterday's 88-point recovery from Friday's megadrop in the Dow Jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again.

At Canon Inc., for example, sales are up nearly 20% this year; so, the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances: It is increasing capital spending -- by 60%.
It is building, among other things, a new laser-beam-printer factory in western Japan that can produce up to 150,000 printers next year.
Some 70% of them are to be exported to the U.S..
Japan's steelmakers are raising capital spending 22% this year to $4.8 billion.

That's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting, and we think he deserves as much support as he can get.
Congress, with a measure of White House complicity, has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills.

This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk.
It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid, unserious presidency.
Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats, the lobbyists, the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet.

Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes.
George Bush's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities, rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough.
George Bush's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities, rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough.
If Washington's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam, Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs, such as federalized child care.
Child care was one of the many `` extraneous'' bills pulled out of the Senate's reconciliation bill last Friday.
Others were the capital-gains cut, Section 89 repeal, the disabled workers bill, and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act.
All this stuff still is in the House's 1,878-page reconciliation bill, and many Members say they're reluctant to pull out cherished bills, just to see them die.
Republicans especially want a guarantee from the House leadership that they'll get an up-or-down vote on the bills.
House Speaker Foley ought to deliver that promise.

We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy, breezy days in Washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build, roads paved, soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for.
Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative.
Save the sequester, and let Washington scream.

The hard drive, which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user, also now will supplement Next's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price.

Universities can now buy a Next computer without an optical storage device for $4,995.
A computer with the optical device will still cost $6,495, but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought Next machines.

Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device, which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals.
Another factor was that customers were asking, `` Why do n't you give us a cheaper system?'' Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here.
To get around the delays caused by the optical device, Businessland, which is Next's exclusive dealer to corporations, has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines.

Broad acceptance of Next's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it.
Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks, but the Next computer does n't come with a device that reads them.
Next's computer also needs more software applications, but Mr. Jobs said he expects more soon.

The government's startling allegations, filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court, challenge the motives and veracity of the nation's third-largest defense contractor.
In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday, GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses, distorted documents and ignored important facts.''
The company attacked the government's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging,'' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported'' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices.

GE, which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents, countered that senior GE managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985, and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives.

Apogee Enterprises Inc. said profit for the third quarter ending Dec. 2 will fall below the year-earlier results because of an after-tax charge of $1.9 million related to a project that was guaranteed by the company.
A year ago, the Minneapolis glass products and aluminum window maker earned $4 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $114 million.
Apogee said the charge stems from a building supply contract in which the company guaranteed a contractor's performance.
Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own, making it necessary for Apogee to advance cash to ensure completion of the project.

`` The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates'' in the past two weeks.
The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday.
Typically, banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills, which are considered the safest short-term investments; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products.
Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs, those with denominations over $90,000, also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields.
The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90%, down from 7.93%, Banxquote said.
Mr. Mehl attributed the rise specifically to the Treasury bill increase.

The move is sure to heighten concerns about increased Japanese investment in U.S. biotechnology firms.
It is also likely to bolster fears that the Japanese will use their foothold in U.S. biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages.
Gen-Probe, an industry leader in the field of genetic probes, which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests, last year signed an agreement for Chugai to exclusively market its diagnostic products in Japan for infectious diseases and cancer.

Chugai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs.
That arrangement apparently has worked well, and Thomas A. Bologna, president and chief executive officer of Gen-Probe, founded in 1983, said the sale of the company means `` we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing.''

Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition. `` The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors,'' said Richard Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association.

He added that until now the Japanese have only acquired equity positions in U.S. biotechnology companies.
During the past five years, Japanese concerns have invested in several of the U.S.'s 431 independent biotechnology companies.
Chugai has been one of the most active Japanese players in U.S. biotechnology companies; it has an equity investment in Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., and a joint-venture agreement with Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich.

The Japanese government, Mr. Godown said, has stated that it wants 10% to 11% of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products.
`` It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the U.S. and Japan,'' he said, adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor, electronics, and automobile industries, Japanese companies will use U.S.-developed technology to gain trade advantages.

And, despite its image as a technology superpower, Japan has a lot of weaknesses.
It's a world leader in semiconductors, but behind the U.S. in making the computers that use those chips.
It's a world leader in auto manufacturing, but its aviation industry is struggling, and its space program is years behind the U.S., the Europeans and the Soviets.
One question being debated in the Soviet Union is how to use the defense sector's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy.
The Soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science, which has helped them win twice as many Nobel science prizes as the Japanese.
Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system.
Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets.
Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the U.S., Japan's principal ally. `` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union,'' says a State Department official.

Under Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, the Soviets have sought economic ties all over the world, including new export markets.
They believe technology is one of their best bets, and some Soviet officials say Moscow will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right.
The Soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in New York and West Germany.

But, while the Soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from Japan, they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise. `` The Soviet Union has a lot of know-how, but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy,'' says Mr. Shapovalov, the Foreign Ministry official.

Nearly three-fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned, according to The Wall Street Journal's `` American Way of Buying'' survey.
The Roper Organization, which conducted the survey, said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected.
Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging, tennis, swimming and aerobics.
The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf, a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers.
For instance, sales of treadmills, exercise bikes, stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8% to about $1.52 billion this year, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s.
But even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should. `` The first excuse is they do n't have enough time,'' says research director Thomas Doyle.
Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices.

The company complains that it paid $10 million to non-Humana hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members.
But Humana says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped.
Mr. Conn charges that Humana's own actions undermine its argument.

The Humana hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue, Mr. Conn says, and now charges as much as $8,000 for the procedure, which costs only about $3,500 in Lexington.

Humana, which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself, is on the record as opposed to the proposal.

The 12-bed `` cooperative care'' unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital. `` The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care,'' says Anthony J. Grieco, medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center, where the concept began 10 years ago.

Grieco, medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center, where the concept began 10 years ago.
Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff, room charges are lower -- about $100 less per day than a regular room at the Vermont hospital.
Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy, diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels, and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative-care units.
The approach has generated so much interest that NYU is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30.
`` It's really part of the hospital of the 21st century,'' Dr. Grieco says.

When Thomas W. Wathen went big league last year, he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security business: Pinkerton's Inc.
There was a wanted poster offering `` Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James'' and the original Pinkerton's logo with an open eye and the inscription `` We Never Sleep,'' which inspired the phrase `` private eye.''
Then there were two gold watches once owned by Allan Pinkerton, who founded the company in Chicago in 1850.
Then there were two gold watches once owned by Allan Pinkerton, who founded the company in Chicago in 1850.
But there were supposed to be three, Mr. Wathen's company claims.
The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. Wathen encountered in building his closely held California Plant Protection Security Service into the largest detective and security agency in the U.S. through acquisitions.

The ever-optimistic Mr. Wathen has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name company can be a shortcut to growth, it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems.
Mr. Wathen, who started his career as an Air Force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies, built his California Plant Protection from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the San Fernando Valley.

Over the next 20 years, California Plant Protection opened 125 offices around the country.
Yet although California Plant Protection was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles -- it still did n't have the name recognition of Pinkerton's.

So when American Brands Inc. decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations, Mr. Wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives.
So when American Brands Inc. decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations, Mr. Wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives.
He decided he could easily merge Pinkerton's operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities.
He could acquire a staff of loyal Pinkerton's employees, many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm, he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he'd wanted.
Mr. Wathen also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself, who'd spent his whole career in the security business, could run Pinkerton's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker.

But there were hitches, not the least of which was that, Mr. Wathen says, he proceeded almost blindly in doing the $95 million acquisition, which was completed in January 1988.
Five years of rapid expansion under American Brands, with an emphasis on marketing the agency's services instead of improving them, had hurt Pinkerton's profits, Mr. Wathen claims.

Pinkerton's had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business, with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired, he adds.
American Brands declined to comment on Mr. Wathen's accusations.

The acquisition combined the country's second-largest security company, Pinkerton's, with 1987 sales of $410 million, and the fourth largest, California Plant Protection, with $250 million in sales, creating the industry's biggest firm, which took on the Pinkerton's name.

Even after divesting itself of $120 million of unprofitable business, the new Pinkerton's will have sales of about $610 million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2% -3% of sales, says Lloyd Greif of Sutro & amp; Co. in Los Angeles, which arranged the Pinkerton's acquisition.

Mr. Wathen says his turnaround strategy has been simple: just hack away at the fat.
He shut down the company's tony New York headquarters.
Pinkerton's world headquarters today is a nondescript, two-story office building across the street from the small Van Nuys Airport.

Mr. Wathen, who says Pinkerton's had a loss of nearly $8 million in 1987 under American Brands, boasts that he's made Pinkerton's profitable again.
But Mr. Wathen's team still must pay down about $82 million of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years.
Last year, earnings of the combined companies did n't cover debt service and Pinkerton's was forced to borrow $20 million of subordinated debt.
`` We would n't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems had n't been there,'' Mr. Wathen says.
This year, Mr. Wathen says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit.
Now Pinkerton's could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent.

The key to Pinkerton's future will be sticking to what it does best -- being a security company, says Mr. Wathen.

Although investigations now account for only about 5% of Pinkerton's total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more `` glamorous'' of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value.

But for all its success, CNN has hit a plateau.
CNN executives worry that the network's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV.

Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts.

To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program.

It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see.
And the cable-TV operators -- CNN's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are.
The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive.

CNN wants to change its viewers' habits.
Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers'' and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research.
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels.
CNN's viewer habits have been molded by its format.
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak,'' `` Daywatch,'' `` Newsday,'' and `` Newsnight,'' but the shows varied little in content, personality or look.

CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock, indicating that regulators' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened.
In a statement, Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift's operating losses and `` apparent losses'' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends.

Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock.
David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which issued the directive, saying it was `` inappropriate'' and based on `` insufficient'' reasons.

In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a `` troubled institution,'' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses.
In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track.
For the nine months ended June 30, CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.
CenTrust, which is Florida's largest thrift, holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation.

Mr. Paul said only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The remainder, he said, are commercial loan participations, or private placements, that are n't filed with the SEC and do n't have a ready market.
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds.
The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market.

In a statement Friday, Mr. Paul challenged the regulators' decision, saying the thrift's operating losses and `` apparent'' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank.''
In the third quarter, for instance, CenTrust added $22.5 million to its general reserves.

Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution.
CenTrust, however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.
It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards.
CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company's large amount of good will by about $180 million.
Critics, however, say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds.
Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than $1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due.

`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,'' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.

Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.

Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.

The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,'' said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.

Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which is the most troublesome right now?
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City.

Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically.
Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language.

If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot?
It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.
In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.

The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam?
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers''; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show.''

It could n't be more obvious that `` Chicken Soup'' is being made from an old recipe.
Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of `` Abie's Irish Rose'' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author, Anne Nichols, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.

And it has remained there, as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie,'' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney.

Clearly, the question with `` Chicken Soup'' is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all.
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms, ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear, to preach about social issues.
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona.
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself.
But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade - ethnic differences.
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.
That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer.
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people'' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.

Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October, the first sales period of the 1990 model year.
This appears particularly true at GM, which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3% from last year's unusually high level.

Boeing Co.'s third-quarter profit leaped 68%, but Wall Street's attention was focused on the picket line, not the bottom line.
In fact, the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world's No. 1 jet maker and the striking Machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks.
Doug Hammond, the federal mediator in Seattle, where Boeing is based, said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again.

Doug Hammond, the federal mediator in Seattle, where Boeing is based, said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again.
Despite the progress, Boeing indicated that the work stoppage, now in its 27th day, will have `` a serious adverse impact'' on the current quarter.
Because it's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last, the precise impact on Boeing's sales, earnings, cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined.
Because it's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last, the precise impact on Boeing's sales, earnings, cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined.
The investment community, however, strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either Boeing or its work force.
Before the union rejected the company's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of Oct. 4, Boeing had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period.
That included 21 of the company's 747-400 jumbo jets, its most successful product. `` It's not a pretty picture,'' said David Smith, an analyst with Raymond James & amp; Associates.

But the strike has n't gone on long enough for Boeing to lose business in any real sense.''
That's the primary reason the company's share price has held up so well when, in Mr. Smith's words, `` most companies would have unraveled'' by now.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Boeing closed yesterday at $54.50 a share, off a scant 12.5 cents.

Still, Boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside.
In a statement, Chairman Frank Shrontz asserted that the company `` faces significant challenges and risks,'' on both its commercial and government contracts.
For instance, he noted that spending on Pentagon programs is shrinking, and Boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Air Force's next-generation tactical fighter.

Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work, Mr. Shrontz said, the company's defense business will record `` a significant loss'' in 1989.
Moreover, Mr. Shrontz added, production-rate increases that have been implemented on the 737, 747, 757 and 767 programs have resulted in `` serious work force skill-dilution problems.''

The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10% base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract, plus bonuses of 8% the first year and 3% the second.
On top of that, Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5% for each year of the contract.
For the nine months, Boeing's net increased 36% to $598 million, or $2.60 a share, from $440 million, or $1.92 a share.
In a separate matter, the Justice Department yesterday said Boeing agreed to pay the government $11 million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the Air Force while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the KC-135 tanker aircraft.

A Boeing spokesman responded: `` All along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution.
That was borne out by the Justice Department's decision'' to settle the case.

Intel Corp. reported a 50% drop in third-quarter net income, partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations.

The lower net included a charge of $35 million, equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis, for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany.
Intel's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday, as investors appeared relieved that the company's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter's earnings of $99.3 million, or 53 cents a share, and that sales actually exceeded the $747.3 million for the second period.
But Intel later succumbed to the stock market's plunge, closing at $31.75, down $2.125.
In August, Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down'' from the previous period's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor, start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company's new 80486 chip in the current quarter.

California legislators, searching for ways to pay for the $4 billion to $6 billion in damages from last week's earthquake, are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state's sales tax.
The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.

One immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by Gov. Deukmejian.
The fund has about $1 billion and is set up to handle `` precisely the kind of emergency'' the state faces, said Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary.
But the fund's size is disputed by Mr. Brown's office, which estimates the fund holds from $630 million to $800 million.
Moreover, an aide to Mr. Brown said Gov. Deukmejian `` has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this.''

To push through a sales tax increase, however, the state will have to suspend the Gann limit, citing an emergency.
And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends, said Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state department of finance.
`` If there's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere, I think the attitude will be supportive,'' said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.

Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981, when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $10 million.
Most recently, she has become the publisher of Movieline, a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies.

Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev, when she lived with her parents, her husband and her two sons in a 2 - room apartment in what she calls `` silent internal immigration,'' dreaming of escape.
However, she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban 10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel.

With obvious satisfaction, she says she told him: `` No darling, I just give it a Chanel look.''
She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox.
Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona, along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes, the parties she throws for 500 people, the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara?

I used to wear hats in Russia, but I had to make them and my dresses.
Now 48 years old, Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants.
At Movieline, she wants `` specific paragraphing, specific tone, a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek.''
In restaurants (in this case, the Russian Samovar, a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres), she did n't want the chirpy, folkish music bouncing through the room.

That done, Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with: an understanding of food, business, Russian culture, human nature, and parties.

`` Parties are rather a state of mind,'' she said, pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik (`` a little well done, but very good'').
Even in Russia we managed to give parties.
In Los Angeles, in our lean years, we gave parties.''
As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies, Ms. Volokh sees her party-giving as an important part of business.
I like rather tea, because it is at the end of the day.''
She serves high Russian tea, at 5 p.m.
In Los Angeles, it's important to catch people just after work.''
She also frequently invites directors, producers, actors, writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome.''
Guests bring movies on tape, and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs' art-nouveau library (`` the pleasure dome'').
`` It's very revealing and soul baring,'' said Ms. Volokh.
The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs, Boris Krutchensky (who has the title of co-publisher), and Laurie Halpern Smith, now the magazine's co-editor.

Ms. Volokh quit her job, to remove herself from the public eye.
Before granting Ms. Volokh's parents a visa, the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband, whom she had divorced 38 years earlier.
Mr. Volokh was fired from his job, and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers, accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities.
The Volokhs were afraid that they'd end up like a friend of theirs who'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years, having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk.
Their visa came in relatively short order, and they moved to Los Angeles.
Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field, but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation - as translator for a Russian who spoke fluent English.

On the way to that goal, she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry, attended secretarial school, then went to work for a fund-raising organization.
When her husband and son founded their computer company, Vesoft, she worked as business manager, bookkeeper and publicist.

Qintex Australia paid the management company A $32.6 million in the latest fiscal year.
Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel, but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services.
Non-executive directors of Qintex Australia, who must approve payments to the senior executives, balked at the amount.
Two of the directors resigned, Mr. Skase said, so the payments have n't yet been approved.
When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s, Akzo NV fell out of bed.
Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business, which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company's sales, led to huge losses and left Akzo's survival in doubt.
It was n't until the early 1980s that Akzo nursed itself back to health.
Now, as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms, Akzo says it is in far better shape to cope.
Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants, Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders ($1.88 billion) on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance.
The fibers business, whose products go into textiles, carpeting and myriad industrial uses, now accounts for only 20% of Akzo's sales.
`` We have definitely become less cyclical,'' Syb Bergsma, executive vice president-finance, said in an interview.
Still, Akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs.

But he said Akzo is considering `` alliances'' with American drug companies, although he would n't elaborate.
An indication of Akzo's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results.
A bigger test will come next year if, as many analysts expect, bulk chemical prices slump in Europe.
`` Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit,'' said Jaap Visker, an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV.

He figures Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year.
The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990, up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988.

We're sorry to see Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government.
But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing, especially if it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved.

They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest, producing sudden capital inflows.
As in the U.S., it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling, that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates, M-Whatever.
At this point, the options were: Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates, as Sir Alan surely advised, and forget the soaring pound.
To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit, a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous.
Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate, as the Chancellor argued, and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS.
Faced with a similar situation, Paul Volcker let the dollar soar, (though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation).
But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, laying the seeds of protectionism.
Mr. Lawson, though not allowed to join the EMS, chose to `` shadow'' the deutsche mark.

He reaped inflation along with rapid growth, no doubt validating Sir Alan's predictions in the Prime Minister's mind.
But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation, which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it.
So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion.
We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson's resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy, John Major.

Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one.
We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise.

Mr. Reynolds also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements, high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession.
We would add that in political terms, Mrs. Thatcher's problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser.
So Mr. Lawson had to resign.
In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan's autobiography in The American Economist, a 10,000-circulation academic journal.

Surrounded by stacks of paper, two computers and photos of himself boating and flying, Mr. Phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency.
First and foremost, Mr. Phillips said he hopes to improve client service.
Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients, of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed, must -- follow.

But Mr. Phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy.
He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to, such as Lever Brothers, American Express and Seagram.

Under the reorganization, Ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a `` client service director'' to work as the client's single contact for all those services.
`` There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus,'' Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced.
Now Mr. Phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including American Express, American Telephone & amp; Telegraph and Ryder -- by year's end.

Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year.

Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff, closed the executive dining room and, after the takeover, let go half a dozen financial executives.
WPP, which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way, instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy's new headquarters building to outsiders.

When Westinghouse Electric Corp. shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in Lester, Pa., three years ago, it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business.
But now Westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers.
And with its new venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., announced last week, it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas.
And with its new venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., announced last week, it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas.
For the first time since the mid-1970s, Westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants.
Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities, and Westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years.
Analysts agree, predicting that the revived market could significantly boost Westinghouse's bottom line in coming years.
`` Westinghouse's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner,'' says Russell L. Leavitt, of Salomon Brothers Inc.

The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade.
Already this year, it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & amp; Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp., among others.

Westinghouse's own role as a supplier also is changing.
But last June's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age.
Westinghouse's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & amp; Chemical Co.

Westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with Misubishi, giving it an edge in developing Asian markets.

In addition, the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology, such as the plants ordered by Florida Power, and even utilize each other's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations.
`` Even though we'll still compete against Mitsubishi, we can also work jointly on some projects, and we'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility,'' Mr. Stern contends.

Still, Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities, which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates, are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity.

The British press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government.
Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark.
Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy.
As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar'' either to gold or other currencies, the dispute is worth examining.
Until his resignation, Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark.
When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%, Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.
When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%, Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.
As a result, he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher, through a long and costly effort, had subdued.
To keep the exchange rate pegged, Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%.
This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher's policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls.
This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher's policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls.
Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher's political fortune, Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System, which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy.

Edouard Balladur, the finance minister at the time, was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship.
To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise.
Consequently, Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row.

Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office.
Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office.
It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound.
Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s.
This policy is totally mindless, and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies.

The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate.

The administration's plan could cost utilities, mainly those that use coal, up to $4 billion a year.
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House's work on clean-air legislation.
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation.

Mr. Dingell's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing.
It is n't clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House's acid-rain plan.

While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns.

At age eight, Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal.

At age 19, she was a Paris sensation, transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade.
And, for Ms. Baker, the ride was far from over.
Bricktop, another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris, said: `` I do n't think I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than Josephine's.''

Baker had lots of them.
She adopted 12 of assorted races, naming them the Rainbow Tribe, and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina.

Paris loved her at first sight.
`` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her,'' sniffed the literary world's Maria Jolas, not entirely inaccurately.
`` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end,'' Ms. Rose writes.
Ms. Rose, who teaches literature at Wesleyan University, quickly proceeds to overemphasize, claiming that Baker's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire'' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous.

`` Jazz Cleopatra'' contains other, more important, false notes that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.
It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts Ms. Rose, the author of `` Parallel Lives,'' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage.

Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.
To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with Cleopatra, requires an equal stretch.

GAF, Part III is scheduled to begin today.
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations.
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986.

The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky, and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.

Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing.
But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived.
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document.

Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June.
A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government.
In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts.
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the GAF case.
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo.

DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal.

Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare, and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case.
Under Superfund, those who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup, regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time.
Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities.
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment.

The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group.
The murderer, Ronald Gene Simmons, was convicted of killing 14 people.
Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons's death sentence in a `` next friend'' capacity.
Wilmer Cutler's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing.
P.J. Mode, Wilmer Cutler's managing partner, says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised.

But while further modest declines might be ahead, Mr. Hafer said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday's high.

`` The implied current net asset value of 22.70 { per share } is well below the 30 level that the Street believed,'' PaineWebber says.
So what is Santa Fe worth?
If the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of CNW -- it would have a value of $1.65 billion.
Santa Fe also has $3.7 billion in debt.
But Santa Fe, currently trading at 18, is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets, because the tax against it would be onerous.
Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's chairman, argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways, `` the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole.''

Since most of the unit's real estate is in California, the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards.

Mr. Phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades.
Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue, but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely, as some investors want, would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse.''

Mr. Phelan has n't been making public remarks in recent days, and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue.
What the Big Board is considering is re-establishing a `` collar'' on program trading when the market moves significantly.
Early last year, after a 140-point, one-day drop in the Dow, the Big Board instituted the collar, which banned program trading through the Big Board's computers whenever the Dow moved 50 points up or down in a day.

The basket product, while it has got off to a slow start, is being supported by some big brokerage firms -- another member of Mr. Phelan's splintered constituency.
Mr. Phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the Big Board is serious about curbing volatility, especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $200 billion in stock-index funds, which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & amp; Poor's 500, and which sometimes employ program trading.

`` I think if you { can } speed things up, you can slow them down,'' Mr. Phelan said.
For example, Mr. Phelan said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market, regardless of index arbitrage.

UAL Corp.'s board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out, saying United Airlines' parent should remain independent for now.

As a result, UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company.
As a result, UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company.
Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC, the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid, withdrew its support.
UAL, which had risen $9.875 to $178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group, reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement.

Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & amp; Co., which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed, were 10,000 shares at $170, 6,000 shares at $162, 2,500 at $162, and 10,000 at $158.

The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41% below its level before Oct. 13, the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal.
Twelve of UAL's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid.

The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the broader public... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong, viable, independent company.''
Mr. Wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention'' to operating the airline.
But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again.
For a brief time, the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United's pilot union.
As a `` good-will measure,'' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft.

The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United's pilot and machinist unions.
The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf, but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union.
The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out.
Until the collapse of this bid, Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines.

Dell Computer Corp., squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line, said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts.
Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31, are expected to be released the third week of November, according to Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Dell said he does n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth quarter, but said third-quarter earnings could be as low as four cents a share.
In the third quarter last year, Dell had net income of $5 million, or 26 cents a share, on sales of $75.2 million.
Mr. Dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays, such as a laptop scheduled for September that wo n't be introduced until early November.
Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably Intel Corp.'s newest chip, the 486 -- but others apparently have been caused by Dell's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources.

Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics producer, said it had net income of 5.64 billion yen ($39.7 million) in its first half, which ended Sept. 30.
The Tokyo-based company had net of 3.73 billion yen in the previous reporting period, which was the four months ended March 31.
Shiseido predicted that sales for the year ending next March 31 will be 318 billion yen, compared with 340.83 billion yen in the year ended Nov. 30, 1988.
The government's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2% in September, but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing.

The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan.
The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index, the influence of this component has been reduced.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61% do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later.
Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates, 60% of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates.
The other 40% said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down.
Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
As expected, the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant's performance.
Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months.

Mr. Stookey said of the boom, `` It's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks.''
But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum's profit is plummeting.

A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy.
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders, because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases.
Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend, raised 36% to 75 cents a share only a year ago, has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts.

Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower, but declined to specify a figure.
He added the original offer was `` a pretty full price,'' and that British Air's contribution `` was quite a large chunk for us.''
British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15% stake in the company, but was n't particularly happy with paying $750 million.
In any new proposal, British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20% - plus in the original proposal.
In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid, the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction, even without any legal obligation to do so.

Orders for military goods usually catapult in September, government officials say, as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders.
`` It means we're eating into the bread that keeps us going.
That is a little disturbing,'' Ms. Kleinman said.

Dow Jones said it extended the offer to allow shareholders time to review a supplement to the Dow Jones tender offer circular that it mailed last Friday.

Greece's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5.
For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign: The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass.

The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was, in essence, little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation: On one side, the center-right New Democracy Party, headed by Constantine Mitsotakis.

The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain: PASOK (Mr. Papandreou's party) as common political enemy.

The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption, purportedly at all levels, but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates.
With regard to Greece's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal, Mr. Papandreou's principal accuser remains George Koskotas, former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in Salem, Mass., from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece.

Mr. Koskotas's credibility is, at best, problematic.
Nevertheless, the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity.

Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $734,000 in bribes, as contended; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $57 million in Mr. Koskotas's bank and then skim off the interest; and, what PASOK's cut was from the $210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched.

In the end, the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications'' that point to PASOK, not clinching proof.
On another issue, Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency, the EYP, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures, including key opposition politicians, journalists and PASOK cabinet members.

Naturally, neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid (or not) to various Greek officials for services rendered.

So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter: PASOK, whether guilty or not, can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou's expense.

Then, to buttress his credibility with the left, he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner.
Next, he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate.

For balance, and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes, he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis.

Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench, but also with `` seals of approval'' from representatives of its harshest accusers.
Crucial as these elections are for Greece, pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle.
The country's future NATO participation remains unsure, for instance.
Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation.
Greece's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well.

That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable; the Greek press, previously eager to palm off PASOK's line, has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance.

If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader, he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition.
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK, forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product's flaws.
The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc., claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer, introduced in 1983.

According to the suit, Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year.
The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare, the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa.
The suit claimed Apple's stock climbed to a high of $63.50 a share on the basis of the company's optimistic forecasts.
But when the company revealed Lisa's poor sales late in 1983, the stock plummeted to a low of $17.37 a share, according to the suit.
In 1987, the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company's statements by alerting consumers to Lisa's problems.

Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks.

For the broader market, the greatest significance of the Vitro-Anchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $155 million temporary `` bridge'' loan from Donaldson, Lufkin & amp; Jenrette Securities and a $139 million loan from Security Pacific National Bank.

Donaldson's statement is n't merely an idle boast, because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson's bridge loan can be paid back.

On Friday, LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much, dropping 5, or 4.9%, to close at 107.
Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were n't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers.

Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses.
People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing.

However, they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers.
Hilton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company's stock.
William Lebo, Hilton's general counsel, said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track'' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process.''

And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit.
Reggie Jackson, the retired baseball star, has found another use for them.
Mr. Jackson, who won the nickname `` Mr. October'' for his World Series exploits, is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $500 each.

Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I've invested in during this prosperous decade (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20, 1989).
Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985, at which point the industry, while not lighting up any Christmas trees, began a slow recovery.
By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she'd `` never seen anything like it.''
Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market, which was booming until I entered it in late 1988, at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years.
Your priorities may be different, but here in Figure 2 is where I've chosen to build for the future: personal space; automotive pursuits; children's toys; gardening equipment, bulbs and shrubs; and finally, entertainment, perhaps the best investment of all.

Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters: dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off.

IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers, entertainment producers, masons, roofers, and taxi owners.
Small businesses in general account for almost 40% of unreported personal income, the IRS has said.
Once such abuses become so pervasive, the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them.
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula, not because IRS agents envy their life styles.
Many openings for mass cheating, such as questionable tax shelters and home offices, have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them.
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers.
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony (who gets a deduction) must report the former spouse's Social Security number.

Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers, enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns.
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these, the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention.
In most cases, the IRS says, these projects are local or regional, rather than national, and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among, say, factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses.
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects, according to Marshall V. Washburn, deputy assistant commissioner for examination.
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics, housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees, to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes.
And now that returns must show dependents' Social Security numbers, the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased.

It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs, Mr. Washburn says.

For 1984, they reported gross income of $1,647 from Amway sales, offset by expenses totaling $16,746 -- including car costs of $6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $5,088.
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins, who earned $65,619 in their regular jobs, treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits'' from it.

The independent-contractor project, which began in 1988, involves about 350 IRS agents.
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30, reports Raymond P. Keenan, assistant commissioner for collection, they examined about 13,000 employers, assessed more than $67 million in delinquent employment taxes, and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors.
But many others, who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the IRS, says Jerry Lackey, who manages the IRS project's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando.

The IRS assessed the clinic $350,000 in back payroll taxes.
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $80 million computer system in 1985.
The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses; from exchange agreements with the IRS, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages.

Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns.
The state has combed through records relating to architects, stockbrokers, lawyers in the New York City area, construction workers from out of the state, and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida, which has no personal income tax.

Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state, doctors, dentists, and accountants, says Frederick G. Hicks, director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs.
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $500,000 who were filing nonresident returns, it squeezed $7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident.
`` We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project,'' Mr. Hicks declares.

Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33% between 1986 and last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads.
The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18% in 1987 and 13% in 1988 on rural interstates.
`` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel, and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors { primarily to greater speed },'' according to NHTSA.

About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways, sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday.
In other words, it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute.
The massive temblor, which killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south.
The massive temblor, which killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south.
It will take several weeks to repair the bridge, and several months to repair some of the 101 connections.
But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm, gridlock never materialized, mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50% more passengers than normal.
For the first time in memory, it was standing-room only in BART's sleek, modern railcars.
Moreover, the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls, allowing traffic to zip through without stopping.

Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge, which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span, actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations.
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge, which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span, actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations.
In the best of times, the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region, often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more.
Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway, and many commuters had to find rides to BART's stations, because parking lots were full before dawn.
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray, stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan.
Her commute from Petaluma, Calif., normally takes an hour and 15 minutes, via the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area.

Bechtel Group Inc., the giant closely held engineering concern, says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement, whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work.

Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically, anyway -- like an old tin can.
Playing black in the first game, the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought, known for its attacking prowess, into a totally passive position.
And in the second game, with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white, D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster.
Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer, he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected.
And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall, he called the outcome.
As if he were Iron Mike, about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling, he declared: `` I'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years.''
His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games, he said, including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S..

Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed.
Its chief builder, Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu, nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel'' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions.

D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory, is utterly fearless, and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall, in the New York Academy of Art.
In fact, D.T. never left home, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link.
In fact, D.T. never left home, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link.
They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov, but they put their hope in D.T.'s recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second, from 720,000.
But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips; they needed kryptonite.
This became apparent as game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded.
No human can examine millions of moves, but Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones.
After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980.
After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980.
But the computer did n't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly.
`` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players, and computers,'' said Edmar Mednis, the expert commentator for the match, which was attended by hundreds of chess fans.
It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T.'s knights.
Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights, but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T.'s surviving bishop was reduced to passivity.
While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch, Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost.
No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T.
Now, with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood, the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two.
Now, with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood, the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two.
With the advantage of playing white (which moves first), Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer's defense, a Queen's Gambit Accepted.
As early as move six, Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves, developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer's advanced knight.
`` In a new position just after the opening, a computer will have serious problems,'' Mr. Kasparov said later.
Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player'' would have avoided the queen move.
On a demonstration board, emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice; no spectator refuted this line of play.
Mr. Kasparov's continuation was slower but, in the end, just as deadly.
And Mr. Kasparov, to cheers and applause, marched back into the analysis room.
Indeed, three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp.

In May 1986, Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & amp; Co. about $40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9%.
In May 1986, Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & amp; Co. about $40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9%.
`` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly,'' Dr. Blumenfeld recalls.
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%, and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%.
But nearly 3 years later, Merrill says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000.
But nearly 3 years later, Merrill says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000.
Instead, his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD, which is sold at a deep discount to its face value.
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then, part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD's increased market value.
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent, and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance.
The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD's `` estimated current market value'' had plummeted by $9,000 in a month.
Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique.
`` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things,'' says John Markese, research director of the American Association of Individual Investors, a Chicago-based educational group.

Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium.
Nevertheless, Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & amp; Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated and the CD terminated, the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid.

Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells, which it did n't provide in 1986.
Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs.
Whatever the case, a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes, investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue, unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate.
Dr. Blumenfeld says he's satisfied that his problem has been resolved.
