In Los Angeles, Arco Plaza was sold to Shuwa Corp. for $620 million in 1986, and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $300 million for Atlanta's IBM Tower last year.
For Mitsubishi Estate, the Rockefeller purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business, the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as Mitsui, which had purchased the Exxon Building.
Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop Marunouchi into a business center of high-tech buildings, a project budgeted for 30 years and six trillion yen.

Because it's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last, the precise impact on Boeing's sales, earnings, cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined.

Moreover, Mr. Shrontz added, production-rate increases that have been implemented on the 737, 747, 757 and 767 programs have resulted in `` serious work force skill-dilution problems.''
Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from Canada's National Energy Board to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. starting in 1996.
Foothills' main rival to build a Mackenzie Delta pipeline is likely to be TransCanada PipeLines.
Like Foothills, TransCanada's Polar Gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's western Arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily.
Mr. Jesperson's US $3.25 estimate is somewhat below the $3.39 floor price that Calgary-based consulting firm Paul Ziff & amp; Co. recently said would be needed for Mackenzie delta gas producers to see a return on their investment.
If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators, Foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline.

Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative).
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee, the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics, but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled.''

At James Capel & amp; Co. in London, analyst Jackie Ashurst notes that Akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products.
For example, Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations, is small in plastics and does n't make fertilizers.
Akzo also makes products derived from salt, such as chlorine and caustic soda.
But Akzo is still slimming down: It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany.

The Pale Pachyderms propelled six of'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the San Francisco Giants.
That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, trailing 8-2, they scored four times and brought their big heat -- Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell -- to the plate with one out and a runner on.
The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record.
He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One, and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake.
The other is that he's an Oakland native, and lifted residents' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas last week.
`` Give me four or five more Series with these guys, and I do n't care if I ever win a Cy Young,'' he said, in reference to baseball's best-pitcher award.

Another lifelong complication, as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time'' (Doubleday, 321 pages, $22.50), was racism.

Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses, the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less, as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial `` Subsidizing Disaster.''
Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands, such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston.
Baseball, that game of the long haul, is the quintessential sport of the mean, and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.

Nevertheless, the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity.
Next, he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate.
That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable; the Greek press, previously eager to palm off PASOK's line, has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance.
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK, forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles.

Unknown to Mr. Tharp, he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes.

The massive temblor, which killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south.
It will take several weeks to repair the bridge, and several months to repair some of the 101 connections.
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge, which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span, actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations.
In the best of times, the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region, often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more.
Her commute from Petaluma, Calif., normally takes an hour and 15 minutes, via the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area.
But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate, by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out.
At the San Mateo Bridge, which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay, police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved.
The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday, but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush.
One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay.
Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act,'' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone, compared with the normal 70% rate.
